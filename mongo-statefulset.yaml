# Stateless apps are deployed using deployments component
# Stateful apps are deployed using StatefulSet components (mostly statful apps that need replication)

# NOTE : statefulsets allow replication and configuring storage same as deployments
# DIFFERENCES from deployment :
# 1- cant be created / deleted at the same time
# 2- cant be randomly addressed
# 3- sticky identity for each pod (-created from same specfication but not interchangeable-) (allow to retain state and retain role)
# 4- persistant identifier accross any re-scheduling (exp: ID-0 , ID-1 , ID-2)

# WHY this pod identity is necessary?
# for answering this we need to know about data base replication 
# while replicationg data base , we are going to have master salve pattern
# the master can do read / write operations
# the slaves can only do read operations 
# each pod is going to have its own data storage , wether transient or persistand vol, and it cntains
#  2 type os data 1- actuall db data 2- Pod State

# 5- Pod identity is not random (predictable name ) -> $(statefulset name)-$(ordinal) -> exp : mysql-0 (master), mysql-1 (slave), mysql-2 (slave)
# pod deletion is also from end 2 -> 1 -> 0

# 6- Fixed individual dns names -> $(podname).$(governing service domain) -> exp: mysql-0.svc2 , mysql-0.svc2

# NOTE: 1- predictable podname and fixed individual dns name leads to when pod restart IP address will change
# but the NAME and ENDPOINT stays the same
